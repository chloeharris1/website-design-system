# Website Design System


## Description 
This project, from Codecademy's Front-End Enginner path, is a style guide/design system for a website. Developers and designers use design systems in order to organize the look and feel of a website or web application. Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.

As websites grow larger and more complex, having a consistent set of styles helps them stay cohesive and enjoyable for users. It also helps when working with other developers, as you can have a consistent reference for how your website should be built.

This style guide/design system includes sections on colors, fonts, and specific text styles.
